This is a workspace project for multiple web apps development.

We leverage the following tools for better DX:

1. pnpm workspace
1. VSCode workspace
1. [Nx](https://nx.dev/)

Here are the architecture of this workspace:

1. `apps/` contains apps. Each app is a standalone repo.
1. `libs/` contains shared codes across apps.
1. `templates/` contains repo templates to create a new app. Typically, one choose a template and copy it to `apps/`, adjust some configs, `git init`, and you get a ready-to-go app repo ðŸŽ‰
1. `publications/` contains some "publication" projects of workspace. For example, we can use [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to demo the components your organization create. Maybe you can use [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) as organization documentation site or blog.
